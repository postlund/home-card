# Home Card

A quick glance of the state of your home in [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) Lovelace UI.

![Demo of card](images/demo.gif)

*Note: This card is still in early development (preview/proof-of-concept), beware of bugs and lacking features!*

## Features

* Graphical representation of your house with different themes
* Displays things such as weather, state of lights and garage door as well as arbitrary sensors
* Create your own custom themes!
* Transparent or regular paper card background
* Othings small things...

## Roadmap

Some things I want to add in upcoming releases:

* Much better error handling, especially for misspelled entity_ids
* Custom tap and hold actions, like in the stock entity-button card
* More house types and better graphics
* Extend with additional overlays for things like alarm, people and doors
* More ways to customize how the card looks and feel
* Extend or override existing themes using `custom_themes`
* Lovelace UI editor
* Support for custom_updater
* Better development environment with linting, etc.
* Other cool things?

## Install

### Simple Install

1. Download `home-card.js` and `themes` and copy them into `config/www/home-card` (create the `home-card` directory)

2. Add a reference to `home-card/home-card.js` inside your `ui-lovelace.yaml`

  ```yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/home-card/home-card.js?v=0
      type: module
  ```

### Git Install

1. Clone this repository into your `www`-directory: `git clone https://github.com/postlund/home-card.git`

2. Add a reference to `home-card/home-card.js` inside your `ui-lovelace.yaml`

  ```yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/home-card/home-card.js?v=0
      type: module
  ```

### Custom updater

Not using this yet...

## Updating

If you...

* manually copied the files, just download the latest files and overwrite what you already have
* cloned the repository from Github, just do `git pull` to update

... and increase `?v=X` to `?vX+1`.

## Using the card

### Card layout

The card is split into three different areas:

![Structure of card](/images/structure.png)

Explanation of each area:

* Weather area (Red): Displays current weather with an icon (e.g. sun or cloud) and temperature. Name of location is displayed as well. Controlled by the `weather` option.
* House area (Green): Main visualization of the house. Consists of `overlay` images that can be shown or hidden depending on an entity state. A car overlay (image) can for instance be shown if `device_tracker.car` has the state `home`. Controlled by the `entities` option.
* Resources (Blue): Simplistic view of sensors. Controlled by the `resources` option.

Both the weather and resources areas are optional and will not displayed if omitted from the configuration. The house area are however mandatory.

### Options

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| type | string | **required** | `custom:home-card`
| theme | string | **required** | Name of a theme, see [supported themes](#supported-themes)
| background | string | transparent | Supported values: empty, `transparent`, `paper-card`
| weather | string | optional | `weather` entity used for displaying location and temperature
| entities | object | optional | List of [entity objects](#entity-object)
| resources | object | optional | List of [resource objects](#resource-object)
| custom_themes | object | optional | List of [theme objects](#theme-object)

#### Supported themes

The following themes and overlays are currently supported:

| Theme | Overlays |
|------|----------|
| two_story_with_garage | garage, upstairs_light, downstairs_light, car

These states are supported by the overlays:

| Overlay | States | Component examples |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| car | home, not_home | device_tracker
| downstairs_lights | on, off | E.g. light, binary_sensor
| garage | open, closed | cover
| upstairs_lights | on, off | E.g. light, binary_sensor

You may add additional state mappings using a `state_map` to support other component types, see [Entity object](#entity-object).

#### Entity object

An `entity object` maps an entity in Home Assistant to an overlay in the card, e.g. which `device_tracker` entity that shows/hides the car or which `light` that corresponds to "upstairs".

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| type | string | **required** | Overlay type, see [overlay tabe](#supported-themes)
| entity | string | **required** | Entity id from Home Assistant, e.g. `light.downstairs`
| state_map | map | optional | Key-value map of state (in Home Assistant) to overlay state

A simple example of an entity object in yaml looks like this:

```yaml
- type: car
  entity: binary_sensor_.car
  state_map:
    on: home
    off: not_home
```

#### Resource object

A `resource` is a simple sensor that is displayed beneath the house, e.g. a temperature sensor or water usage. You can use any entity but you might have to manually specify an `icon` and/or `unit_of_measurement`.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| entity | string | **required** | An entity from Home Assistant, e.g, `sensor.water_usage`
| icon | string | optional | Override icon to use, e.g. `mdi:car`
| unit_of_measurement | string | optional | Override unit of measurement, e.g. `lux`

A simple example of a resource object in yaml looks like this:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.water_usage
  icon: mdi:water
  unit_of_measurement: liter
```

#### Theme object

**THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND MAY BREAK LATER - BEWARE!**

You can define your own themes and use your own images if you like. Some things to consider:

* Keep images small (in size) to keep everything snappy
* Re-use overlays and names as much as possible to keep themes consistent
* If you make a cool looking theme, feel free to send a PR (make sure to clarify where images come from to cope with licenses) and remember to include a screenshot
* It is currently not possible to alter/extend existing themes, only define additional themes

The format of this object will be described in more detail once the format has been set, but have a look at the [example](#creating-custom-themes) to see how you configure your theme in current state.

### Example usage

#### Defining a house

Simple example using basic features:

```yaml
- type: 'custom:home-card'
  theme: two_story_with_garage
  weather: weather.home
  entities:
    - type: garage
      entity: cover.garage_door
    - type: upstairs_light
      entity: light.demo_upstairs_light
    - type: downstairs_light
      entity: light_downstairs_light
    - type: car
      entity: device_tracker.car
  resources:
    - entity: utility meter.water
    - entity: utility meter.electricity
    - entity: binary_sensor.movement_backyard
      icon: 'mdi:alarm-light'
    - entity: sensor.outside_temperature
      icon: 'mdi:thermometer'
```

#### Re-mapping states

Here, the `car` type is used as an example. It requires the specified entity to be a `device_tracker` as it maps states like `home` and `not_home` to different overlays. But you can add additional mappings to support for instance a `binary_sensor` as well using `state_map`, like below:

```yaml
- type: 'custom:home-card'
  theme: two_story_with_garage
  entities:
    - type: car
      entity: binary_sensor_.car
      state_map:
        on: home
        off: not_home
```

#### Creating custom themes

You can define you own themes quite simply using `custom_themes`. The basic structure looks like below (`car` is used to illustrate, you may add as many overlays as you like):

```yaml
- type: 'custom:home-card'
  theme: my_house
  entities:
    - type: car
      entity: device_tracker.car
  custom_themes:
    my_house:
      house: house.png
      overlays:
        car:
          home:
            - image: car_home.png
              style:
                left: 10%
                top: 10%
          not_home:
            - image: car_away_.png
              style:
                left: 40%
                top: 40%
```

Some notes here:

* You can defined multiple images for each state if you like (as a list is used)
* `style` translates to CSS style attributes, so you may use any CSS attributes here
* The theme is called `my_house`, so a directory with the same name must be created in the `themes` directory and all images placed there
* The `house` option is the main backdrop image and must be defined
* Overlay name (e.g. `car`) corresponds to `type` you specify under `entities` and may be anything you like (but try to be consistent with other themes to simply for other users in case you share your theme)
* If an entity in Home Assistant has a state that is not defined by its corresponding overlay, no overlay will be shown

## Issues and imitations

* No custom tap or hold action for entities
* Toggle is used as defult tap action, which does not work for `cover` and does not make sense for `device_tracker`
* No lovelace configuration UI
* Only one theme built-in

## Getting errors?

Clear the browser cache, restart Home Assistant and make sure the configuration is correct (currently the card does not give proper error messages if you misspell an entity name in most places).

If you believe you have found an error, please write an issue.
